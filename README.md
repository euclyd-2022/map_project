# map_project
JSON dataset of lat/lon used to create a shipping path on a map using python/folium. The blue pins are the start and end points of the journey, the purple marker is the current position in the json dataset, the idea was to create a video with purple pin moving along the grey path, leaving it blue in its wake.
